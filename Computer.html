<div id = "history">
    The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began
    designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes. Spacewar! was developed by 
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display. 
    The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s. 
     The first home video game console is the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games are Computer Space and Pong. 
    After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by 
    cloning the game, causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation.
    By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the discrete transistorâ€“transistor logic circuitry 
     of the early hardware, and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, 
    including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS). Coupled with rapid growth in the golden age of arcade video games, 
    including Space Invaders and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished. The 1983 video game crash in the United States was
    characterized by a flood of too many games, often of poor or cloned qualities, and the sector saw competition from 
    inexpensive personal computers and new types of games being developed for them. The crash prompted Japan's video game industry 
    to take leadership of the market, which had only suffered minor impacts from the crash. Nintendo released its Nintendo 
    With the introduction of 3D graphics and a stronger emphasis on console games, smaller developers, particularly those working on personal computers, were typically shunned by publishers as they had become risk-averse.[121] Shareware, a new method of distributing games from these smaller teams, came out of the early 1990s. Typically a shareware game could be requested by a consumer, which would given them a portion of the game for free outside of shipping charges. If the consumer liked the game, they could then pay for the full game. This model was later expanded to basically include the "demo" version of a game on the insert CD-ROM media for gaming magazine, and then later as digital downloads from various sites like Tucows. id Software is credited with successfully implementing the idea for both Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, which was later used by Apogee (now 3D Realms), Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games).[122]

Several key genres were established during this period. Wolfenstein 3D and Doom are the formative games of the first-person shooter (FPS); the genre itself had gone by "Doom clones" until about 2000 when FPS became the more popular term.[123] Graphic adventure games rose to prominence during this period; including the forementioned Myst and The 7th Guest, several of LucasArts adventure games including the Monkey Island series. However, the adventure game genre was considered dead by the end of the 1990s due to the rising popularity of the FPS and other action genres.[124] The first immersive sims, games that gave the player more agency and choices through flexible game systems, came along after the rise of FPS games, with games like Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Thief: The Dark Project. Thief also expanded the idea of stealth games and created the idea of "first person sneaker" games where combat was less a focus.[125]

Real-time strategy games also grew in popularity in 1990s, with seminal games Dune II, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans and Command & Conquer. The first 4X (short for "Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate") strategy games also emerged during this decade, popularized by Sid Meyer's Civilization in 1991. Alone in the Dark in 1992 established many elements of the survival horror genre that were in the console game Resident Evil.[126] Simulation games became popular, including those from Maxis starting with SimCity in 1989, and which culminated with The Sims, which was first released in early 2000.

Online connectivity in computer games became increasingly important. Building on the growing popularity of the text-based MUDs of the 1980s, graphical MUDs like Habitat used simple graphical interfaces alongside text to visualize the game experience,. The first massively multiplayer online role-playing games adapted the new 3D graphics approach to create virtual worlds on screen, starting with Meridian 59 in 1996 and popularized by the success of Ultima Online in 1997 and EverQuest and Asheron's Call in 1999. Online connective also became important in genres like FPS and RTS, allowing players to connect to human opponents over phone and Internet connectivity. Some companies created clients to help with connectivity, such as Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net.

During the 1990s Microsoft introduced its initial versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system for personal computers, a graphical user interface intended to replace MS-DOS. Game developers found it difficult to program for some of the earlier versions of Windows, as the operating system tended to block their programmatic access to input and output devices. Microsoft developed DirectX in 1995, later integrated into Microsoft Windows 95 and future Windows products, as a set of libraries to give game programmers direct access to these functions. This also helped to provide a standard interface to normalize the wide array of graphics and sound cards available for personal computers by this time, further aiding in ongoing game development.
